# Dynabook-NB200-BIOS
A modification aported to the phoenix bios for a Dynabook (Toshiba) NB200 serie

# You want to modify it ?
No problem just get the ".ROM" file which is a builded bios,
Open the bios file with "Phoenix BIOS Editor Pro" which is free,
and edit what you want

# You want to use it ?
Just download the ".ROM" file and Winphlash or Phlash (DOS Only)
Then Flash your bios and enjoy
I highly recommand you to create a CRISIS disk before any flash, it can save you from a brick
